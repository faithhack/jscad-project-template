# jscad-project-template
A very simple layout I use with OpenJSCAD V2 when creating 3D printing designs.
This currently depends on https://github.com/jscad/OpenJSCAD.org.git V2 branch with the v2-3d-hull merged in.
The fonts directory is from https://github.com/lautr3k/jscad-vector-fonts with additional single-line fonts referenced 
at http://imajeenyus.com/computer/20150110_single_line_fonts/index.shtml
